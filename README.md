## Do stricter state gun laws have a positive correlation on US mass shootings? 
By Chris Baeurle

### Overview
Gun violence has become normalized in our US society. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shoes a total of 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries of all causes during 2020. More than 19,000 of the deaths were homicides. Data from the Gun Violence Archieve shows mass shootings have been ever increasing. The country continues to argue over gun rights and laws. That begs the question, do gun laws have an effect at all? 

I set out to find if there is indeed a correlation between the states with more regulation and mass shootings.
